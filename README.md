## Overview

This will be a card game that mimics aspects of the card game Magic the Gathering, virtual card game Hearthstone, classic Table Top Games, and the video game Stellaris. The game will be turn based.

## Players
The first version will have one human player and one AI player. Next Iterations will have 2 additional AI players. The final version will implement the ability for multiplayer games.


## Moves
The players will be able to play cards to build a space empire. Players move ships, soldiers and perhaps special agents accross the board to gain special resources, colonies, and to attack other players.


## Future Time Implmentation
I was planning to use the clock to keep track of the seconds and shake and turn red when the player took too long during their turn. I may use a custom clock to achieve this visually.

## sweetalert
I added the dependency Sweet Alert which can be found at the bottom of the index.html page: <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/sweetalert/dist/sweetalert.min.js"></script>

## analogclock
I made the Analog Clock from a lynda.com tutorial, I am going to modify it in my next iteration of the game.
